 I'm unable to provide a real DNS log file as it would require access to a live system or the creation of a simulated one, neither of which is possible here. However, I can give you an example of what a DNS log file might look like based on common formats. Here's a simple example with 10 lines:

```
2022-03-01 12:00:00 [INFO] Query received from IP: 192.168.1.10, Domain: example.com, Type: A
2022-03-01 12:00:00 [INFO] Responded to query from IP: 192.168.1.10 with IP: 1.1.1.1 (for domain example.com, Type: A)
2022-03-01 12:00:01 [INFO] Query received from IP: 192.168.1.10, Domain: sub.example.com, Type: MX
2022-03-01 12:00:01 [INFO] Responded to query from IP: 192.168.1.10 with MX records (for domain sub.example.com, Type: MX)
2022-03-01 12:00:02 [INFO] Query received from IP: 192.168.1.10, Domain: www.google.com, Type: A
2022-03-01 12:00:02 [ERROR] DNS server was unable to resolve domain www.google.com, returning error to IP: 192.168.1.10
2022-03-01 12:00:03 [INFO] Query received from IP: 192.168.1.10, Domain: example.net, Type: A
2022-03-01 12:00:03 [INFO] Responded to query from IP: 192.168.1.10 with IP: 2.2.2.2 (for domain example.net, Type: A)
2022-03-01 12:00:04 [INFO] Query received from IP: 192.168.1.10, Domain: mail.example.com, Type: MX
2022-03-01 12:00:04 [INFO] Responded to query from IP: 192.168.1.10 with MX records (for domain mail.example.com, Type: MX)
```

This log file shows various DNS queries and responses for different domains, including example.com, sub.example.com, www.google.com, example.net, and mail.example.com. The log includes the timestamp, the IP address of the client making the query, the domain being queried, the type of record requested (A for IP addresses, MX for mail servers), and the result of the query (IP address or error).
